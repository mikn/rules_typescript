// srcLabel is the label that names a file the generated package holds, and
// whether Bazel can name it at all.
//
// A bare name is already that label for almost every file. The exceptions are
// the label grammar's two prefixes: "@" opens a repository name and "//" an
// absolute package. "@{$username}.tsx" -- a TanStack route on a dynamic
// segment -- therefore reads as repository "{$username}.tsx" and fails
// `bazel query //...` for the whole workspace with "invalid repository name". A
// leading ":" pins the name to the package being generated, which is what a
// bare name means everywhere else.
//
// A ":" anywhere is the one name no spelling reaches: it splits package from
// target, and a target name may not contain one. Bare, Bazel reads a package
// that is not there; pinned, it refuses with "target names may not contain
// ':'". Nothing else is rejected here -- a name Bazel merely dislikes is still
// a name it can be told about, and dropping a source Bazel would have accepted
// is worse than letting Bazel object to it.
