# ts_compile

Compiles TypeScript with Oxc and checks it with tsgo, which emits the `.d.ts`.

## Usage

```python
load("@rules_typescript//ts:defs.bzl", "ts_compile")

ts_compile(
    name = "lib",
    srcs = ["index.ts", "math.ts"],
    deps = ["//other/package", "@npm//:zod"],
    tsconfig = "tsconfig.json",
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)
```

Unmodified TypeScript compiles: no explicit export type annotations, no extra
flags in `.bazelrc`. Every compiler option is the tsconfig's.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `srcs` | `label_list` | required | The package's files: TypeScript is compiled, JavaScript and declarations join the program, every other file is staged as data. See [Sources](#sources) |
| `deps` | `label_list` | `[]` | `ts_compile`, `ts_codegen` or `ts_npm_package` targets, and a workspace member's link target `//<importer>:node_modules/<name>` |
| `tsconfig` | `label` | `None` | The project's own `tsconfig.json`, or a [`ts_config`](#ts_config) target: where every compiler option comes from. See [Where compiler options come from](#where-compiler-options-come-from) |
| `node_modules` | `label` | `None` | The `node_modules` target of the nearest lockfile importer at or above the package: the chain a direct npm dep resolves along. Required when the closure holds an npm package; Gazelle writes it. See [The node_modules Chain](#the-node_modules-chain) |

Those are the three. The emit knobs are build flags, one value for the whole
build:

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--//ts:declarations` | `string` | `"tsgo"` | Which tool emits `.d.ts`: `"tsgo"` or `"oxc"`. See [Which tool emits the declarations](#which-tool-emits-the-declarations) |
| `--//ts:source_map` | `bool` | `True` | Emit a `.js.map` next to every `.js`. See [Source and declaration maps](#source-and-declaration-maps) |
| `--//ts:declaration_map` | `bool` | `False` | Emit a `.d.ts.map` next to every declaration. See [Source and declaration maps](#source-and-declaration-maps) |
| `--//ts:lib_check` | `bool` | `False` | Turn `skipLibCheck` off for every target. See [Finding a broken declaration](#finding-a-broken-declaration) |

A target that has to be built under another value of one of these is reached
through a Starlark transition; `tests/flags.bzl` is the ruleset's own.

### Sources

`srcs` accepts every file. Four classes of src, by extension:

- **TypeScript**, `.ts` and `.tsx`: compiled to `.js` and `.js.map` -- by oxc,
  or by tsgo when the program's `module` is CommonJS-shaped ([The Module
  Format](#the-module-format)) -- type-checked by tsgo, and declared as `.d.ts`
  by whichever emitter `--//ts:declarations` names. A `.tsx` under
  `jsx: "preserve"` is compiled to `.jsx` and `.jsx.map`, the names tsc gives
  it, with its JSX left for the bundler ([below](#a-tsx-under-jsx-preserve)).
  A `.mts` or `.cts` is refused: the rule emits `.js` and `.d.ts` from `.ts`
  alone, and has no output shape for one.
- **JavaScript**, `.js`, `.mjs` and `.cjs`: staged into the output tree
  unchanged and in the type program. The rule sets `allowJs` for it, so its
  JSDoc types reach consumers; `checkJs` in the tsconfig has its own body
  checked. A `.jsx` is rejected at analysis time: JavaScript is staged
  unchanged, and tsc would transform the JSX in one under every `jsx` mode but
  `preserve`; the message says to rename it `.tsx`.
- **Declarations**, `.d.ts`, `.d.mts` and `.d.cts`: in the type program and
  passed through to consumers unchanged, global when the file has no top-level
  import or export. A `.d.mts` or `.d.cts` is the declaration of the `.mjs` or
  `.cjs` of the same stem, the pairing `tsc` resolves by name, so
  `import { compile } from "./compile.mjs"` resolves to `compile.d.mts` ahead
  of `compile.mjs`, and a checked-in declaration types an untyped JavaScript
  module whether or not that module is in `srcs`. When it is, the `.mjs` is
  staged and leaves the type program: TypeScript keeps the higher-priority
  extension of a pair listed together, as `tsc` does. The checked-in file is
  then the module's only declaration, and `checkJs` does not reach that `.mjs`.
- **Data**, every other file: staged into the output tree unchanged at its
  package-relative path, so the compiled module beside it reaches it by the
  same relative path at run time -- `import data from "./data.json"`,
  `import "./styles.css"`, `new URL("./logo.svg", import.meta.url)`, a
  `readFileSync` of a fixture. A consumer gets the closure as
  `TsInfo.transitive_data`; `ts_test` stages it in the runfiles beside
  the `.js`, `ts_binary` in its runfiles and its bundle, `ts_dev_server` in
  its runfiles. What the import of a data file is typed as is the tsconfig's
  to say: `vite/client` in `types`, or a `declare module "*.svg"` in a
  declaration src. A data file is never a tsgo input, with one class of
  exception: a `.json` is, this target's and its deps' alike. An import of it
  resolves to the file and is typed from its contents under
  `resolveJsonModule`, which bundler resolution implies, and tsc reads the
  nearest `package.json` of every source for the module's format and for the
  package's own name, so a package that imports itself by name
  (`import "@scope/pkg/wire"` from inside `pkg`) resolves through the manifest
  in `srcs`. The src is staged as written, and the `package.json` at the
  package's root is also written as built -- every source-file target
  rewritten to the emitted file, by `tsaction manifest` -- as
  `<name>.package.json`, for the two readers that hold the emit: a dependent's
  program root lays it at the package's path, so a `ts_test` inside the
  package resolves the package's own name to the `.d.ts` beside the test's
  sources ([The node_modules Chain](#the-node_modules-chain)), and the
  member's store tree copies it as its `package.json`. A test's runfiles hold
  the src as written ([Files at Run Time](ts-test.md#files-at-run-time)). See
  [What a Workspace Member Is Imported
  As](../guides/npm.md#what-a-workspace-member-is-imported-as).

Gazelle writes the first three classes from tsgo's listing of the package's
`tsconfig.json` -- a file whose extension tsgo could have listed is a src only
when the program lists it, the JavaScript twin of an owned declaration apart --
and the fourth from the package's tree: every other regular file under it that
no deeper package, `out_dir` or BUILD file claims
([the package model](../gazelle/overview.md#the-package-model)).

### Source and Declaration Maps

Turn `--//ts:source_map` off for a build whose JavaScript nothing debugs, or
whose bundler makes its own map.

`--//ts:declaration_map` is what makes go-to-definition across a package boundary
land on the `.ts` source. It requires the tsgo declaration emit; under
`--//ts:declarations=oxc` it is an analysis error naming both flags, since oxc
emits no map.

A `.js.map` has one shape from either emitter: `sources` names the src by its
exec-root-relative path -- `tests/smoke/hello.ts`, the path Bazel and a
coverage report use -- and `sourcesContent` carries the text, so a consumer
resolves nothing against the map's directory. oxc writes that form. tsgo
writes its maps into `TsEmit`'s scratch `outDir`, `sources` relative to the
map as tsc computes them and `sourcesContent` from `--inlineSources`, and the
move into place resolves each `sources` entry to the exec-root path
([The Module Format](#the-module-format)).
`//tests/compiler_options/source_maps` pins both emitters' maps.

## Outputs

For each source file `foo.ts`:

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `foo.js` | Compiled JavaScript ([The Module Format](#the-module-format)) |
| `foo.js.map` | Source map, under `--//ts:source_map` ([Source and Declaration Maps](#source-and-declaration-maps)) |
| `foo.d.ts` | Declaration file, the compilation boundary |

For a `foo.tsx` under `jsx: "preserve"` the first two are `foo.jsx` and
`foo.jsx.map`, as tsc names them ([below](#a-tsx-under-jsx-preserve)). A
program tsgo emits has one more, `<name>.es/foo.js`: the ES module a vitest
test runs in place of `foo.js` ([The Module Format](#the-module-format)),
in no default output. Every other src is staged at its package-relative path,
unchanged; a `package.json` at the package's root also gets
`<name>.package.json`, the manifest as built ([Sources](#sources)).

## Where Compiler Options Come From

The tsconfig the actions read is written by `tsaction tsconfig`, one `TsConfig`
action per target. It `extends` two files, the ruleset's baseline and then the
target's `tsconfig`, runs `tsgo --showConfig` over that chain to read the
effective options, and writes the keys Bazel owns over both. The pass that runs
`--showConfig` sets `files: []` only when no file in the chain names `include`
or `files`, so tsc neither walks the output directory nor loses the chain's own
`files` list. Lowest precedence first:

1. **The ruleset baseline**: `strict`, `module: "Preserve"`, `target: "es2022"`,
   `jsx: "react-jsx"`, `skipLibCheck`, `esModuleInterop`. Without a `tsconfig`
   they are the program's whole options; with one they reach only the keys the
   file and its own `extends` chain never mention.

   `moduleResolution` is asserted nowhere: TypeScript couples it to `module`, and
   tsgo derives the resolver from whichever `module` wins, `Bundler` for all of
   them but `Node16`/`NodeNext`.
2. **`tsconfig`**: the project's own `tsconfig.json`, and whatever it extends.
   Referenced where it lives, never copied, so relative paths inside it resolve
   against the directory they were written for. Everything it says wins over
   layer 1, so tsgo checks the code under the options `tsc` would.
3. **The keys Bazel owns**, written last: `rootDirs` bridging the source and
   output trees, `declaration`, `emitDeclarationOnly`,
   `declarationMap`, `composite`, `incremental`, `rootDir`; under the tsgo emit
   `noEmit: false`, `noEmitOnError` and `outDir`; `allowJs`
   when a src is JavaScript; `isolatedDeclarations` under
   `--//ts:declarations=oxc`; `skipLibCheck: false` under `--//ts:lib_check`.
   `files` is the srcs the tsconfig's own `include` and `files` name, in the
   order `--showConfig` reports them, and `include` the srcs it does not;
   `exclude` and `references` are `[]`. Two keys are the tsconfig's values
   rewritten: `paths`, each value from the directory of the chain file that set
   it and a `bazel-bin` twin beside it, and `types`, its package names alone:
   each path-shaped entry joins `include` as a root file at the path the
   sandbox stages it (below). A value the tsconfig sets
   for one of these keys is overridden by `extends` order, not refused.

`--showConfig` is run over the chain, not over the user's file alone, so a
default the baseline supplies reaches oxc as tsgo sees it: oxc transforms with
the `target`, `jsx` and `jsxImportSource` the same run yields, handed over in
`<name>.options.json`, and the two compilers agree. The same file carries the
chain's `module`, which decides which tool emits the JavaScript
([The Module Format](#the-module-format)).

A root file keeps a program to its declared inputs. Bazel stages every input as
a symlink into the source tree; tsgo reads a root file, a relative import and a
`paths` match at the path given, and resolves a bare specifier and a type
reference directive to their realpaths. A path-shaped `types` entry is
therefore listed as a root file: read at its staged path, its own imports
resolve among the declared inputs and nothing the source tree has beside them
-- an import inside a staged `.d.ts` that names a file nothing stages resolves
to nothing, and `skipLibCheck` drops the `TS2307`. A package's file resolves at
its realpath, where its own imports are.

Read the tsconfig a target handed the compiler with
`bazel build //pkg:lib --output_groups=tsconfig`.

### A `.tsx` Under `jsx: preserve`

tsc names a `.tsx`'s emit `foo.jsx` under `jsx: "preserve"` and `foo.js` under
every other mode, and leaves the JSX in it for the bundler; a `.ts` is `foo.js`
under every mode. The rule names its outputs at analysis, before any action has
read the tsconfig, so the one compiler option that names an output is declared
on the tsconfig's [`ts_config`](#ts_config), `jsx = "preserve"`. `ts_compile`
and `ts_test` read it through `TsConfigInfo`; Gazelle writes it from the `extends` chain the way it writes `deps`; and the
`TsConfig` action, which runs `--showConfig` over the chain, fails a target
with a `.tsx` src when the declaration and the file disagree:

```
tsaction: pkg/tsconfig.json: jsx is "preserve", so a .tsx emits .jsx, and the
rule declared .js: declare it on the tsconfig's ts_config, jsx = "preserve"
```

A tsconfig passed as a plain file declares nothing, so one that sets `preserve`
fails the same way, for a target with a `.tsx` src, without a `ts_config`;
a `.ts`-only program has nothing `jsx` names. From the declaration on, the
emit is tsc's: oxc names the file `.jsx` when it transforms under
`--jsx preserve`, every consumer stages a `.jsx` as it stages a `.js`, a
`ts_test` runs a `.jsx` test file and resolves a `.tsx`
setup file to it, and the target writes its `package.json` as built with a
`.tsx` target rewritten to the `.jsx`, the manifest the hub's view of a member
links beside the `.jsx` at its package-relative path. Vite transforms a `.jsx`
module and refuses JSX in
a `.js` (`Failed to parse source for import analysis ... If you are using JSX,
make sure to name the file with the .jsx or .tsx extension`), which is what a
`.tsx` compiled to `.js` under `preserve` met. `//tests/jsx_preserve` is the
example: a `.tsx` test file, a `ts_compile` consumer, and a runtime the vitest
config aliases the way `node_modules` would hold a published one;
`//tests/jsx_preserve/member` is a workspace member under it whose `exports` is
`./view.tsx`, imported by name through the view.

The alternative was an emit declared as one directory whose contents tsaction
names after reading the tsconfig. Rejected: a directory's children cannot be
named at analysis, and every consumer names them -- `import "./foo"` resolving
to `bazel-bin/.../foo.js`, the runfiles a `ts_test` stages by path, the member
view's manifest targets, a `ts_binary`'s entry, the `paths` bin-dir twins -- so
the whole per-file output model would have moved into trees for one extension.

### The Module Format

The JavaScript a target emits has the module format tsc gives the program:
`module` in the tsconfig chain and, under `node16`, `node18` and `nodenext`,
the nearest `package.json`'s `type` per file, as tsc reads them. oxc's
transform keeps the module syntax it reads, which is the emit of every ES kind
(`es2015` through `esnext`) and of `preserve`, so those programs are oxc's.
Every other kind -- `commonjs`, the `node*` kinds, `amd`, `umd`, `system` --
is tsgo's: `TsEmit` runs `tsgo --noCheck` from the program root the check
runs in and moves each src's `.js`, `.js.map` and, under
`--//ts:declarations=oxc`, `.d.ts` into place, the map's `sources` resolved
to exec-root paths on the way
([Source and Declaration Maps](#source-and-declaration-maps)). `--noCheck`
emits from the parsed program with tsc's import elision and reports no type
error; the type check stays the tsgo action's, in either mode.

The emit's inputs are the check's for every program -- the srcs, the chain's
links and store files, the tsconfig chain, the deps' declarations -- since
which tool emits is decided when the action runs, so an oxc emit waits for
the store and re-runs when a linked package changes. A CommonJS-shaped program builds the tsgo program twice: once
for the emit under `--noCheck`, once for the check.

A CommonJS program's compiled code has `require`, `exports`, `__dirname` and
`__filename`, and a named import from a CommonJS dependency is that
dependency's export -- `import { app } from "electron"` -- where ES-module
linking sees only what `cjs-module-lexer` finds. Under
`--//ts:declarations=oxc` such a program's declarations are tsgo's
isolated-declarations emit, under oxc's rule: every export annotated. One tsgo
emit has one `rootDir`, so a CommonJS program's srcs hang off one root, as
under the declaration emit ([below](#one-root-per-declaration-emit)).
`//tests/node_test/cjs` pins the format at run time.

The format is the tsconfig's, not the manifest's alone: a package whose
`package.json` has no `type` and whose tsconfig says `module: "ESNext"` emits
ES modules, which node runs as such. A package that runs as CommonJS says so
where tsc reads it, `module: "commonjs"` or `"nodenext"`.

A vitest test runs ES modules whatever the program's `module`
([Runners](ts-test.md#runners)): vitest imports every file through vite's
transform, and the checkout never runs tsc's output under it, so `module`
describes the package's published output and not its tests -- and vitest
refuses a CommonJS importer outright (`Vitest cannot be imported in a CommonJS
module using require()`). A `ts_test` under the vitest runner therefore emits
its own srcs as ES modules (`TsEmit -es_modules`: oxc's transform with the
chain's `target` and `jsx`, reading the srcs and the options alone), and a
`ts_compile` whose program tsgo emits also emits the ES twin of each `.js`:
`foo.js` and `<name>.es/foo.js`, oxc's transform of the same source in a
second `TsEmit`. A vitest test that depends on it stages the twin at the
`.js`'s runfiles path, so `import "./foo"` and a `setupFiles` entry reach the
ES module; every other consumer -- node:test, `ts_binary`, a member's hub view
-- runs the `.js`. The twins travel in `TsInfo.transitive_es_twins`
([providers](providers.md#tsinfo)), a runner asks for them with
`TsTestRunnerInfo.es_modules`, and they are in no default output. The
alternative, a configuration transition on a vitest test's deps, would build
every program a vitest test reaches a second time; a twin is one oxc run over
a program tsgo emits, and nothing else changes.

The rule names its outputs before any action reads the tsconfig, so, as with
`jsx`, the `module` that names the twins is declared on the tsconfig's
[`ts_config`](#ts_config): `module = "commonjs"`, `"node16"`, `"node18"` or
`"nodenext"`, lowercased as tsgo prints it, and unset for an ES kind or
`preserve`. Gazelle writes it from the `extends` chain, and the `TsConfig`
action fails a target with a `.ts` src when the declaration and the chain's
effective `module` disagree:

```
tsaction: pkg/tsconfig.json: module is "commonjs", so tsgo emits the
JavaScript and a vitest test runs its ES twins, and the rule declared none:
declare it on the tsconfig's ts_config, module = "commonjs"
```

A tsconfig passed as a plain file declares nothing, so a CommonJS-shaped one
fails the same way without a `ts_config`. `//tests/vitest/commonjs` is the
example: a `module: commonjs` package with no `type`, whose setup file imports
vitest from the `ts_compile` the test depends on.

### Comments

The compiled JavaScript keeps the comments the source has above its
statements. Under oxc, a comment above a top-level statement the transform
erases -- an `import type`, an import whose every binding the file uses as a
type, an `interface`, a `type` alias -- moves to the next statement the source
keeps, or to the file's end when none follows, so a file that opens with
`// @vitest-environment node` over an `import type` keeps the docblock above
its first remaining import; vitest reads it from the file it runs, under Bazel
the compiled sibling. tsgo's emit drops such a comment.
`//tests/vitest/docblock` pins it.

### What Fails Before tsgo Runs

Analysis rejects a `.jsx` src, a directory in `srcs` (a `ts_codegen` `out_dir`
tree belongs in `deps`), a `.mts` or `.cts` src,
`--//ts:declaration_map` under `--//ts:declarations=oxc`, and a target with
sources and no tsgo toolchain. One more is the root check below. `tsaction`
fails the `TsConfig` action on a path-shaped `types` entry no input sits at
([a `types` entry that names a declaration file](#a-types-entry-that-names-a-declaration-file)),
naming the entry, the tsconfig and the path it looked for, and on a `jsx` or
`module` declaration the chain's effective value contradicts
([above](#a-tsx-under-jsx-preserve); [The Module Format](#the-module-format)),
naming the edit.

### One Root per Declaration Emit

One tsgo declaration emit has one `rootDir`. A checked-in source hangs off the
package directory, a generated one off the package's directory in `bazel-bin`,
and a src from another package off that package's directory. A target whose
srcs hang off more than one root fails at analysis under the tsgo declaration
emit, and a CommonJS-shaped program's `TsEmit` fails it the same way when it
runs ([The Module Format](#the-module-format)):

```
ts_compile: srcs on @@//src/app:app hang off 2 different roots, and one
declaration emit has one rootDir:
  bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/src/app
  src/app
```

Put the generated sources in their own target and depend on it, or, for an
ES-module program, build with `--//ts:declarations=oxc`, under which oxc runs
once per root. A target holding only generated sources has one root and builds
under either emitter. A descendant package's file is inside this package's
directory and shares its root; a `.d.ts` from anywhere is passed through, not
compiled, and is not judged.

## Deps Have to Be Direct

A source may import only what a **direct** dep provides. The one tsgo action a
target runs -- `TsgoDeclare`, or `TsgoCheck` under `--//ts:declarations=oxc`
-- runs with `--explainFiles`, and tsaction reads the listing it prints, every
file in the program with the edge that brought it in, against an ownership
manifest the rule writes beside it: the target's own srcs, each first-party
target in the closure with the files it stages (`TsInfo.owners`), and the
closure's packages by store tree -- the tree each link of `deps` enters, and
every other tree the closure holds with the hub label to add. An edge from one
of the target's own files into a file whose owner is not in `deps` fails the
action, naming the label:

```
ERROR: .../src/app/BUILD.bazel:3:11: TsgoDeclare //src/app:app failed: (Exit 1)
tsaction: //src/app:app imports files no direct dep provides:
  src/app/main.ts imports "./hidden"
    resolved to bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/src/app/hidden.d.ts
    add //src/app:hidden to deps
  src/app/main.ts imports "zod"
    resolved to .../node_modules/.pnpm/zod@3.24.2/node_modules/zod/index.d.ts
    add @npm//:zod to deps
Each reaches this target only through another dep's own deps. Run Gazelle,
which writes deps from these edges, or add the labels above by hand.
```

`bazel run //:gazelle` writes those labels from the same listing. There is no
flag and no opt-out. The npm label in the message is the hub's root view,
`@<hub>//:<name>`; Gazelle spells a name under the nearest importer on the
chain that declares it, `@npm//web:zod`, the resolution the importing file's
walk up meets first
([The Lockfile Gate](../gazelle/overview.md#the-lockfile-gate)).

**What is checked:** every `Imported via`, `Referenced via` and `Type library
referenced via` edge whose importer is one of the target's own files -- a
type-only import, a `paths` alias, an `import()` type, a `/// <reference
path>`, a `/// <reference types>` and the JSX runtime import tsgo adds to every
`.tsx` alike, since tsgo resolved each one and says which file it landed in. A
file under the store is its tree's: tsgo lists the realpath,
`node_modules/.pnpm/<key>/node_modules/<name>/...`, and the manifest carries
the key of the tree each link of `deps` enters, so an npm alias -- a link name
at the aliased package's tree, `tailwindcss-v3` at `tailwindcss@3.4.18_...` --
is declared by the name the importer links. A direct package's `@types/<name>`
twin, which an importer on the chain links beside it, counts as declared. An
edge into the target's own srcs passes. An import of a package's
`package.json` lands on the manifest as built the program root lays at the
package's path, and the compile that wrote it owns it as it owns the src
([The node_modules Chain](#the-node_modules-chain)).

**What is exempt:** an edge from a dep's own file -- its imports are that dep's
to declare, and a `/// <reference types>` the chain answers is written from the
listing
([Import Resolution](../gazelle/overview.md#import-resolution)); a tsconfig
`types` entry, which is an entry rather than an edge; the
toolchain's `lib.*.d.ts`; and a specifier tsgo could not resolve, which has no
file to own and is `TS2307`. A target with no program -- declarations alone in
`srcs` -- runs no tsgo action, and so has no edges to check.

### The node_modules Chain

npm packages reach tsgo the way they reach node: through the `node_modules`
directories above the importing file. `node_modules` names the nearest
lockfile importer's target at or above the package, and a direct npm dep
resolves along it and its `parent`s nearest first, pnpm's walk-up: the link
whose store is the dep's resolution is the one the program reads
([The Chain](node-modules.md#the-chain)). A name no importer on the chain
links fails analysis naming the nearest importer's `package.json`; a name an
importer links at another resolution fails naming the label to write,
`@npm//web:marked`. The action stages the chain's links for the direct names,
the `@types/<name>` twin an importer links beside one, the member links `deps`
name, the store trees and edge links their closures hold, the lockfile's hoist
links whose names the closure holds with the trees they enter
([The Store](node-modules.md#the-store)), and every
first-party dep's (`TsInfo.npm_files`): a dep's emitted `.d.ts` imports the
packages the dep declared, and they resolve from the dep's own importer's
links, an ancestor of its declarations under `bazel-out`.

tsgo walks up from the importing file for a bare specifier, and nothing above a
source in the exec root is an action output, so `tsaction tsgo` lays out a
program root under the target's output directory -- a symlink to every
top-level entry of the exec root, each importer's `node_modules` at the
importer's directory (made a real directory of links down to it), the
lockfile's root importer's at the root's `node_modules`, and the outputs of
every first-party dep whose package is at or above the target's laid over that
package's directory, its declarations beside the sources and its
`package.json` as built at the package's path -- and runs tsgo from there. A
bare specifier, an `exports`
condition, a subpath, a `@types/*` pairing, a `types` entry and the package's
own name through the nearest manifest resolve as tsc resolves them over a pnpm
install, and a declaration tsgo emits names a package the way that package's
`exports` allow. A file the root links is listed by its path under the root,
which the ownership check reads through the link to the dep's output. A
package's own imports resolve from its realpath in the store,
`node_modules/.pnpm/<key>/node_modules/<name>/`, to the edges beside its tree,
so every dependent reaches the resolution pnpm recorded for it, and an import
of a name the package does not declare to the hoist's link at
`node_modules/.pnpm/node_modules/<name>`, as in the checkout. npm deps
contribute no other input: a `ts_compile`'s `transitive_declarations` holds
first-party declarations alone, and a package's file sits under
`node_modules/<name>/`, the segment TypeScript reads to take it for a library
file, type-checked and never emitted.

A workspace member is one of those packages. Its importer's link target,
`//<importer>:node_modules/<name>`, enters the member's store tree, which
holds the member's `package.json` as built -- every source-file target under
`main`, `module`, `browser`, `exports` and `imports` rewritten to the emitted
`.js` (the `.jsx` for a `.tsx` under `jsx: preserve`), `types` to the `.d.ts`
-- beside the member's `.js` and `.d.ts` at the paths the manifest names, so
the bare name and each `exports` subpath resolve for tsgo and for node through
one manifest. See
[what a workspace member is imported as](../guides/npm.md#what-a-workspace-member-is-imported-as).

### `@types/*` Packages

DefinitelyTyped publishes `x`'s declarations as `@types/x`, and a scoped
`@a/b`'s as `@types/a__b`. The hub pairs the two from the lockfile, and a
`ts_npm_package` carries its paired `@types/*` package in `transitive_deps`, an
importer that declares both links `@types/x` beside `x`, and tsgo pairs them
by walking `node_modules/@types`, as it does over an install. Which of the two a name
resolves to follows npm: `x` is answered by the runtime package when it
publishes declarations of its own, and by `@types/x` when it publishes none. A
`@types/*` entry that forwards (`@types/bun/index.d.ts` is exactly
`/// <reference types="bun-types" />`) resolves the directive through the same
walk.

`types` is written from the chain's entries. When the chain sets neither
`types` nor `typeRoots`, the direct `@types/*` deps' names are written, so
nothing auto-includes: a `@types/*` package the closure carries but no entry
names is in the store for the imports that reach it and out of the global
scope, and a use of its globals is `TS2304`.
`//tests/npm:transitive_types_probe` pins that. A chain that sets `typeRoots`
and no `types` gets no `types` key: those roots bound automatic inclusion, as
in the checkout, and tsgo skips the `node_modules` walk for a `types` name
under a custom `typeRoots`, so a deps' name written there is `TS2688`; a store
file's own `/// <reference types>` still resolves beside the referencing file.
`//tests/npm/type_roots` pins that.

### Finding a Broken Declaration

The baseline sets `skipLibCheck: true`, so a `.d.ts` whose own imports do not
resolve reports nothing. What it exports becomes `any`, and the first visible
error is elsewhere, typically a `TS7006` on a callback parameter in application
code.

`--//ts:lib_check` turns `skipLibCheck` off for every target in the build, over
whatever the target's tsconfig says:

```bash
bazel build //... --//ts:lib_check
```

It reports findings unrelated to the one being chased: a `lib` a dependency
needs and the program does not set reports here too. It is a diagnostic sweep,
not a build mode.

### What Is in Global Scope

A `.d.ts` with no top-level import or export is a **global script**, and
everything it declares belongs to every program the file is part of. Under the
chain a file joins the program by import, where a bare specifier resolves to
the package's module entry and no further, and by `types`: the chain's entries
or, when the chain sets neither `types` nor `typeRoots`, the direct `@types/*`
deps' names; a chain that sets `typeRoots` admits what those roots hold.
`@sentry/cloudflare`'s declarations import `@cloudflare/workers-types`, and
that resolves to the package's `index.ts`, a module; its `index.d.ts`, 15k
lines of global script, enters a program only through a `types` entry that
names the package. A worker names it in its tsconfig; a browser target that
depends on `@sentry/cloudflare` does not, and keeps `lib.dom`'s `Element`.

An import of a package the closure does not carry is `TS2307`. A `declare
module "x"` in a `.d.ts` src answers it, since nothing resolves the specifier
first.

### Importing Another Target by Bare Specifier

Two kinds of target answer a bare specifier. A pnpm workspace member is imported
through its importer's link target, `//<importer>:node_modules/<name>`, and
resolves through the store like any npm package; its `exports` map, rewritten
to the emitted files, decides what
`@acme/ui` and `@acme/ui/button` are. Any other first-party target is reached
through the tsconfig's `paths`: the rule rewrites each value to the source
directory and its `bazel-bin` twin, so a dep's declarations and a `ts_codegen`
`out_dir` tree resolve through the alias the tsconfig already has.

```jsonc
// apps/web/tsconfig.json
{ "compilerOptions": { "paths": { "#shared/*": ["../../packages/shared/src/*"] } } }
```

```python
# apps/web/BUILD.bazel
ts_compile(
    name = "web",
    srcs = ["main.ts"],          # import { flag } from "#shared/flags";
    tsconfig = "tsconfig.json",
    deps = ["//packages/shared"],
)
```

The value is read from the directory of the chain file that sets it, which
`--showConfig` does not print, so tsaction walks the `extends` chain for it. A
value import through an alias needs the module at runtime, which a dep on the
producing target gives a `ts_test` or `ts_binary`; a `ts_test` resolves the
alias to it as the compile did
([ts-test.md § A `paths` Alias](ts-test.md#a-paths-alias)).

### ts_config

Starlark cannot read a file, so a `ts_config` declares what a rule needs from
the tsconfig before any action runs: the `extends` chain, every file of which
becomes an input to the type-check action, and the two compiler options that
name an output -- `jsx = "preserve"` when that is the chain's effective `jsx`
([above](#a-tsx-under-jsx-preserve)), and `module` when the chain's is one
tsgo emits, which names the ES twins a vitest test runs
([The Module Format](#the-module-format)):

```python
load("@rules_typescript//ts:defs.bzl", "ts_compile", "ts_config")

ts_config(
    name = "tsconfig",
    src = "tsconfig.json",
    deps = ["//:tsconfig.base.json"],
    jsx = "preserve",
)

ts_compile(
    name = "lib",
    srcs = ["index.tsx"],
    tsconfig = ":tsconfig",
)
```

Gazelle writes all three from the chain
([the tsconfig and its ts_config](../gazelle/overview.md#the-tsconfig-and-its-ts_config)).
A tsconfig that extends nothing, does not set `preserve` and whose `module` is
an ES kind goes straight into `ts_compile`:

```python
ts_compile(
    name = "lib",
    srcs = ["index.ts"],
    tsconfig = "tsconfig.json",
)
```

### A Cloudflare Worker

Ambient globals from a generated `.d.ts`, no DOM, and no stray `@types` package
from the dependency graph reaching global scope, all in the worker's own
tsconfig:

```jsonc
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["es2022"],
    "types": ["./worker-configuration.d.ts"],
    "resolveJsonModule": true
  }
}
```

```python
ts_compile(
    name = "worker",
    srcs = ["index.ts"],
    tsconfig = "tsconfig.json",
    deps = [":worker_types"],   # the ts_codegen whose outs write worker-configuration.d.ts
)
```

`types` names a package the chain resolves or a declaration file a dep stages
(both below). Neither puts a dep's globals in scope on its own; the entry does.

### A `types` Entry That Names a Package

`types: ["vite/client"]` names a package, and tsgo resolves it as tsc does over
an install: the package's own `types`, an `exports` subpath
(`@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers/types`), a directory the package ships at that
subpath (`@cloudflare/workers-types/2023-07-01`), or the paired `@types/*`
package (`node` is `@types/node`). The package has to be on the chain -- an
importer's link, or an edge in a dep's closure -- and an entry the chain does
not answer is tsgo's `TS2688: Cannot find type definition file`, from the
action.

tsaction sets no `typeRoots` of its own. With a custom `typeRoots` tsgo skips
the `node_modules` walk for a `types` entry, and that walk is the only place an
`exports`-only subpath resolves; a chain that sets one keeps it, and its `types`
entries resolve under those roots alone, as they do in the checkout.

### A `types` Entry That Names a Declaration File

`types: ["./worker-configuration.d.ts"]` names a path. tsc resolves it against
the tsconfig's own directory, and tsaction lists the file as a root of the
program at the path the sandbox stages it, found with tsc's lookup: the path as
a file, the path with a TypeScript or declaration extension added, or a
directory's `index.d.ts`, in the source tree first and under `bazel-bin`
second. A checked-in declaration is in the source tree; a
generated one, such as the [`ts_codegen`](ts-codegen.md#cloudflare-worker-bindings)
running `wrangler types` writes, is in `bazel-bin`. What stages the file is a
label: `srcs`, or a dep whose `srcs` hold it or whose `outs` write it (a `.d.ts`
in `srcs` is passed through unchanged, so a dep edge stages it at the path the
entry names). Gazelle writes that dep from the tsconfig
([a declaration the tsconfig names](../gazelle/overview.md#a-declaration-the-tsconfig-names)).

An entry nothing stages fails the `TsConfig` action before tsgo runs, where
tsgo's own `TS2688` would name no dep:

```
tsaction: compilerOptions.types entry "./worker-configuration.d.ts" in
worker/tsconfig.json names worker/worker-configuration.d.ts, which no input of
this action sits at: not in the source tree, not under bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin.
A declaration this program names is a src of the target or an output of one of
its deps.
```

Only the two relative shapes are paths. `./x.d.ts` and `../x.d.ts` resolve
against the tsconfig's directory; anything else (`x.d.ts`, `vendor/x.d.ts`) is a
package name to tsc and to tsaction alike. A `../` entry reaches a file in an
ancestor directory, the way a test directory's tsconfig names the worker's
declaration beside the tsconfig it extends.

Such an entry is for globals. A module (a `.d.ts` with a top-level import or
export) resolves and joins the program, but its declarations stay scoped to it;
a module augmentation inside it needs the module in the program, which the entry
gives it.

### Ambient Precedence

The target's own declarations are root files, in the order the tsconfig's
`include` gives them and ahead of what `types` brings in -- a path-shaped entry
is listed after every src -- so where two declare the same `declare module`
pattern the one the tsconfig lists first wins, and the project's own beats a
`types` entry's. `tsc` orders them the same way: a
`types` entry arrives as a type-reference directive, which joins the program
after the root files. The first declaration of a pattern wins, and a narrower
pattern does not change that: an earlier `declare module "*.svg"` beats a
later `declare module "*.icon.svg"` even for `star.icon.svg`.

To let a package's ambient win instead, drop the project's competing
declaration.

### Which Ambients a Consumer Gets

A global `.d.ts` in `srcs` types the target that owns it and travels to every
consumer as a declaration output, and a consumer's program holds what its own
`include` and `types` name. So a consumer that needs the globals names the file
in its own tsconfig `types`, with the owning target in `deps`:

```python
# workers/proxy/BUILD.bazel -- worker-configuration.d.ts is a src of :proxy
ts_compile(
    name = "proxy",
    srcs = ["src/handler.ts", "worker-configuration.d.ts"],
    tsconfig = ":tsconfig",
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)

# workers/proxy/test/tsconfig.json: "types": ["../worker-configuration.d.ts"]
# workers/proxy/test/BUILD.bazel
ts_test(
    name = "test_test",
    srcs = ["handler.test.ts"],
    tsconfig = ":tsconfig",
    deps = ["//workers/proxy", "@npm//:vitest"],
)
```

A package can hold an ambient it needs for its own standalone `tsc -p` that is
no part of its public type surface, such as a `process` shim in a library with no
`@types/node`, and no consumer sees it unless that consumer asks. The unit is
the file: TypeScript decides module-or-global per file. A `.d.ts` mixing a shim
for the package's own build with a declaration consumers are meant to have is
two files.

A consumer that uses a global no entry supplies sees the identifier as
undefined. Two things supply it: a `@types/*` dep of its own (`@types/node` for
`process`, in `types` or as a direct dep when the tsconfig sets neither `types`
nor `typeRoots`), or the owning target's file named in `types`.

## Which Tool Emits the Declarations

The program's `module` decides which tool emits the JavaScript ([The Module
Format](#the-module-format)); `--//ts:declarations` decides which tool produces
the `.d.ts`, for every target in the build.

### `--//ts:declarations=tsgo` (default)

tsgo emits declarations from the complete type program: the target's sources,
every first-party dep's `.d.ts` and the store files the chain reaches.

- **No source annotations required.** Inferred export types are fine.
- **Declarations are exactly what `tsc` would emit**, including inferred object
  shapes, literal unions and `RegExp`.
- **Type errors fail `bazel build`.** The `.d.ts` are real outputs of the tsgo
  action, so a target with a type error produces nothing. No
  `--output_groups=+_validation` needed.
- **Type-checking is on the critical path.** A consumer waits for its
  dependency's declarations.

### `--//ts:declarations=oxc`

Oxc emits declarations syntactically, per file, with no type program -- tsgo's
isolated-declarations emit does the same for a CommonJS-shaped program. This
requires [isolated declarations](../getting-started/isolated-declarations.md):
every export needs an explicit type, and the emitter **errors** when one does
not have one. Type-checking moves into the `_validation` output group, off the
critical path, so downstream targets compile while checking runs concurrently.

Set it in `.bazelrc` once every package's exports are annotated.

## Cost of Each Mode

Measured with:

```bash
tools/bench_declarations.sh 20 50 3
```

1,000 annotated files across 20 packages in one linear dependency chain,
medians of three interleaved runs:

| Mode | Rebuild wall | Critical path |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| `--//ts:declarations=tsgo` | 6.3s | 4.89s |
| `--//ts:declarations=oxc` | 3.8s | 2.15s |

The benchmark's programs are ES modules, so tsgo runs once per target in
both modes and the gap is serialisation. Under `oxc`
the check is a validation action nothing waits for, and the critical path is
Oxc's per-file transform; under `tsgo` each of the 20 links waits for its
dependency's declarations. The gap shrinks on shallower graphs and widens on
deeper ones.

## Providers

The fields, and the load path, are in
[Providers and Toolchains](providers.md).

- **`TsInfo`**: this target's `.js`, `.js.map`, declarations and data srcs as
  direct depsets and the closure of each over its first-party deps as
  transitive ones, plus the npm packages that closure imports. `ts_binary` reads
  the transitive `.js` set; `ts_test`, `ts_binary` and `ts_dev_server` stage
  `transitive_data` beside the `.js`; a downstream `ts_compile` type-checks
  against `transitive_declarations` and stages `npm_files`
- **`OutputGroupInfo(tsconfig=...)`**: the tsconfig this target handed the
  compiler, on any target with a program
- **`OutputGroupInfo(_validation=...)`**: the tsgo check stamp, written only
  under `--//ts:declarations=oxc` (under the default the declarations are the
  tsgo action's own outputs), and the `TsLint` stamp when the root module's
  `ts.lint()` names a linter ([Lint](../guides/lint.md)).

## Architecture

Three actions per target, each a function in `ts/private/actions/` --
`tsconfig.bzl`, `emit.bzl`, `tsgo.bzl` -- and a fourth, `lint.bzl`'s
`TsLint`, when the root module's
`ts.lint()` names a linter ([Lint](../guides/lint.md)); the rule in
`ts/private/rules/ts_compile.bzl` declares the outputs, calls them in this
order and builds the providers.

`TsConfig` writes `<name>.tsconfig.json` and `<name>.options.json` from
`tsgo --showConfig` ([above](#where-compiler-options-come-from)). `TsEmit`
reads the options file's `module` ([The Module Format](#the-module-format)):
for an ES-module program it runs oxc over each root's `.ts` files with the
file's `target`, `jsx` and `jsxImportSource`:

1. Parse (oxc_parser)
2. Semantic analysis (oxc_semantic)
3. Isolated declarations emit (oxc_isolated_declarations), only under `--//ts:declarations=oxc`
4. TypeScript/JSX transform (oxc_transformer)
5. Code generation (oxc_codegen) for `.js` + `.js.map`

For a CommonJS-shaped program it runs `tsgo --noCheck` from the program root
below, with the emit shape on the command line, and moves the outputs into
place, each map's `sources` resolved to exec-root paths.

tsgo runs from the program root, with `--project` on the written tsconfig and
`--explainFiles`; tsaction reads the listing against the ownership manifest
([Deps Have to Be Direct](#deps-have-to-be-direct)).
Under `--//ts:declarations=tsgo` that tsconfig sets `declaration`,
`emitDeclarationOnly`, `rootDir` and `outDir` so the emitted declarations land
beside the `.js` (mnemonic `TsgoDeclare`). Under `oxc` it runs with `--noEmit`
and writes only a stamp (mnemonic `TsgoCheck`); `rootDir` is the exec root
there, which every input is under, since tsgo checks the program against it
even when nothing is emitted (`TS6059`).

## Output Paths

Output paths are derived from source file names, not target names, so
`import "./foo"` resolves to `bazel-bin/.../foo.js`. Two `ts_compile` targets in
the same package therefore cannot list the same source file: Bazel reports
conflicting actions. Split by directory, or give each target its own sources.
