# Providers and Toolchains

The contract a rule outside this ruleset writes against: the providers the
rules return, and the toolchains they resolve. Four providers load from
`@rules_typescript//ts:defs.bzl`; the toolchain contract loads from
`@rules_typescript//ts/toolchain:defs.bzl`.

```python
load(
    "@rules_typescript//ts:defs.bzl",
    "BundlerInfo",
    "DevServerInfo",
    "TsInfo",
    "TsTestRunnerInfo",
)
```

| Provider | Returned by |
|---|---|
| `TsInfo` | `ts_compile`, `ts_codegen`, `ts_binary`, the `@npm` package targets and a member's hub view |
| `TsTestRunnerInfo` | `//ts/runners:vitest`, `//ts/runners:node_test`, a runner of your own |
| `BundlerInfo` | any rule that [brings its own bundler](../guides/bundling.md#custom-bundler-bundlerinfo-interface); the ruleset ships none |
| `DevServerInfo` | `//vite:dev_server`, a [server of your own](../guides/dev-server.md#bringing-your-own-server) |

## TsInfo

A dep provides one thing: what a consumer's program and runtime need. `TsInfo`
carries the files a consumer stages, its npm closure and the store files it
reaches, and `deps` on `ts_compile` and `ts_test` accepts any target returning
it.

A direct field carries only what the target itself produces. A rule that
forwards a dep's files leaves the direct field empty and puts the closure in the
transitive one; `ts_compile` does that for its deps' data files, which reach
`transitive_data` and never `data`. A consumer that wants everything reachable
reads the transitive field. Declarations have no transitive field: the
closure's are the `owners` records', one per target, so a consumer reads them
all or leaves a target's out.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `js` | `depset of File` | The `.js` files this target produces: compiled output, plus any JavaScript src staged as-is |
| `js_maps` | `depset of File` | The `.js.map` beside them |
| `declarations` | `depset of File` | The declarations this target produces, plus the ambient ones it passes through from `srcs`. Emitted when a consumer's compile reads them or `--output_groups=declarations` asks, never as a default output ([Which Tool Emits the Declarations](ts-compile.md#which-tool-emits-the-declarations)). A global one is in scope in a consumer only when the consumer's tsconfig `types` names it |
| `data` | `depset of File` | Non-program srcs and explicit `ts_compile.data` assets. Assets use package-relative paths; JSON follows the importing module's runtime layout, with original paths for an all-source closure |
| `manifest` | `File or None` | The package-root npm publication manifest: `<name>.package.json` with entry points projected when emission is enabled or runtime placement changes; the original File for source mode with an unchanged layout. A dependent's compiler overlay and a member's store tree use it. Runtime package scopes use the `package_scopes` projection; explicit JSON modules in `srcs` retain authored contents, subject to scope compatibility ([Compiler inputs and emitted layout](ts-compile.md#compiler-inputs-and-emitted-layout)) |
| `sources` | `depset of File` | The original source Files the compiler reads as its own: `.ts`, `.tsx`, JavaScript and declarations. A `ts_test` under the same `tsconfig` checks them as its own program's inputs; runtime placement uses the recorded source/runtime pairs ([The Test's Program](ts-test.md#the-tests-program)) |
| `tsconfig` | `File or None` | The `tsconfig.json` the program's options come from, the `tsconfig` attribute's file: the identity a `ts_test` joins a dep's sources by |
| `transitive_js` | `depset of File` | Every `.js` from this target and its first-party deps |
| `transitive_js_maps` | `depset of File` | Their `.js.map` |
| `transitive_data` | `depset of File` | The data files of this target and its first-party deps: what a compiled module reaches beside itself at run time or in a bundle |
| `transitive_es_twins` | `depset of (File, File)` | For a program tsgo emits, each `.js` of this target and its first-party deps paired with the ES module oxc emits from the same source; the vitest runner stages the second at the first's runfiles path ([The Module Format](ts-compile.md#the-module-format)) |
| `npm_packages` | `depset of NpmPackageInfo` | The npm closure of this target's deps: what the ownership manifest names and a runner checks its packages against. A package itself arrives through its `NpmPackageInfo` |
| `npm_files` | `depset of File` | The store files this target's program and runtime reach: the importer links of its direct npm deps and their `@types` twins, the member links its deps name, every store tree and edge link of their closures, the hoist links whose names the closure holds with the trees they enter ([The Store](node-modules.md#the-store)), and its first-party deps' `npm_files`. An action stages this and nothing else of the store. A dep's emitted `.d.ts` imports the packages the dep declared and resolves them from the dep's own importer's links, which this depset carries into the consumer's action |
| `owners` | `depset of struct(label, files, declarations, type_inputs, importers)` with optional `declaration_files`, `canonical_links`, `asset_files`, `runtime_files`, `runtime_scopes` and `npm_bindings` | One record per first-party target in the closure, this one first: `label`, the string a `deps` list writes; `files`, its owned files for the [strict-deps check](ts-compile.md#deps-have-to-be-direct); `declarations`, its own alone; `type_inputs`, consumer compiler inputs including declarations and declared package scopes; `importers`, its npm importer directories. A consumer reads each record's `type_inputs`; [joining its sources](ts-test.md#the-tests-program) removes only its `declarations` from that set. Optional `runtime_files` contains immutable `(source File, runtime File)` pairs for runfiles File identity and package-scope projection. An npm package's declarations arrive through `npm_files` |

An emitted library publishes source/runtime pairs for shared module placement,
runfiles admission and package-scope projection. A source-mode consumer of a relocated dependency records its original source and staged TypeScript File in the same pairs; `sources` and compiler inputs keep their original identities. A custom producer supplies `runtime_files` as a
tuple of pairs constructed from its actual source and output Files. An empty
tuple states that the owner has no runtime mappings. These mappings do not
establish which imports survive emission or whether relative imports resolve.

Optional `declaration_files` is a tuple of exact `(source File, declaration File)` pairs allocated by the producer. Compiler consumers use the source origin to overlay the canonical declaration at the path the original import resolves to. Runtime consumers use `runtime_files` to place canonical dependency links when an emitted program spans source roots. See [Shared Source Layout](ts-compile.md#shared-source-layout). Older records may omit `declaration_files`; their declarations retain the existing published-path overlay behavior.

Optional `canonical_links` records exact `(link File, canonical File)` pairs the producer creates for dependency placement or unchanged scope symlinks. A workspace member's npm store may copy metadata-only scope aliases backed by those identities and scope records. It rejects selected module and declaration aliases, including scopes used as JSON modules: copying their bytes would lose the canonical dependency's package scope and npm importer. Use a separately published npm dependency or include its sources in the member. Links outside the store's selected files do not restrict publication; older records may omit this field.

Optional `asset_files` records immutable `(original File, logical coordinate, published File)` triples for ordinary data whose bytes are unchanged. The coordinate is the producer's package-local view: `//app` packaging `//assets:theme.css` records `app/assets/theme.css`; external producers use an `external/<repository>/` prefix. Consumers use only records whose published File is live in `transitive_data`. Multiple aliases of the same original and coordinate are valid; different originals at one coordinate fail. A consumer may link directly to that exact original File without selecting an alias by order. JSON modules and scope projections retain their separate module/scope records; a File explicitly declared as both `type_inputs` and `data` retains both roles. Older providers without asset records keep ordinary pass-through behavior; consumers do not infer origins.

Previous owner records may omit `runtime_files`. The consumer preserves their
original records and published runtime File identities at their exec paths,
without inventing pairs or adding an empty field. Declaration-only and
runtime-bearing custom producers need no edit to retain this contract.

Optional `runtime_scopes` is a tuple of immutable `(original scope File,
runtime File)` pairs, separate from module mappings. Consumers reuse a pair
only while its runtime File is in `transitive_data`. Older records may omit
the field: ordinary data passes through, but a new scope placement cannot
reuse an unproven occupant at its destination.

Optional `npm_bindings` is a tuple of immutable `(package name, importer link File, store tree File)` facts. Binaries and tests preserve these positive source-owned lookup contexts beside each admitted runtime module and its package scope. A test's selected ES twin or staged TypeScript retains the canonical module's source provenance. Consumers retain every declared binding; they do not infer an empty lookup context from emitted syntax. Older records may omit the field and retain their previous behavior without invented binding facts.

A dep reached through the store -- an `@npm` package, a member's link target
-- reaches the consumer's program and runtime there: `ts_compile` reads
`npm_packages` off it and none of its file fields, and stages its link and
store files, so an npm package's `TsInfo` stages nothing by path and its
`owners` is empty. A first-party dep's files are staged
at their exec paths, its `declarations`, `js` and `data` are what an import may
resolve to, and its `owners` record is what names it when an import does
([Deps have to be direct](ts-compile.md#deps-have-to-be-direct)).

`ts_binary` with a `bundler` returns the bundle as the one member of both `.js`
fields, and the entry's data closure; without one it returns the entry's
`TsInfo`. `ts_codegen` with `out_dir` returns the directory as the one member
of `js` and `declarations`; nothing downstream compiles the tree, so what it
holds is already compiled output. An `outs` codegen returns its `.js` outs in
`js` and its `.d.ts` outs in `declarations`, so `deps = [":worker_types"]` is
legal and a consumer's tsconfig `types` can name the generated declaration.

A global `.d.ts` travels as a declaration output and nothing more: the consumer
names it in its own tsconfig `types` to bring its globals into scope. See
[Which ambients a consumer gets](ts-compile.md#which-ambients-a-consumer-gets).

## TsTestRunnerInfo

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `packages` | `list of string` | The npm packages the runner needs in the test's npm closure, `vitest` for the vitest runner; `ts_test` fails at analysis naming the one no dep provides |
| `hook` | `File` | The one module the runner loads into node before the tests: the node:test runner's resolver, the vitest runner's reads recorder |
| `es_modules` | `bool` | `True` when the runner runs the program as ES modules whatever its tsconfig's `module` -- vitest -- so `ts_test` emits its srcs as such and stages a dep's ES twins; `False` for node:test, which runs the package's format ([Runners](ts-test.md#runners)) |
| `launch` | `function` | The runner's half of one test's analysis: given the action-owning `ctx` and the struct `ts_test` builds from the compile, it returns the launcher config's mode and section, the env, and the runfiles the runner adds |

A runner is a target, the way a toolchain is: `//ts/runners:vitest` and
`//ts/runners:node_test` are the two shipped, and a rule in another ruleset
returning this provider is a third. See [Runners](ts-test.md#runners).

The callback receives the private executable producer's real `ctx`. Its `ctx.label` owns the generated Files and actions; `ctx.attr.public_name` names the public test in the same package. The public test retains its Bazel test controls, coverage and editor metadata.

The test input's `runtime_files` contains live exact source/runtime pairs, with the test's own `srcs` taking precedence for those sources; `asset_files` contains live ordinary asset records. A runner may return optional `replacements`, an exact original-File-to-replacement-File dictionary. It must omit each replaced File from its ordinary inputs and bind that File's path through `symlinks`; final runfiles admission validates the replacement. Omitting this field preserves ordinary-file precedence.

## BundlerInfo

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `bundler_binary` | `File` or `FilesToRunProvider` | Standalone executable, or executable target with its runfiles |
| `config_file` | `File or None` | A static config passed as `--config`, in mode 1 only |
| `runtime_deps` | `depset of File` | Files the bundler needs at run time |
| `use_generated_config` | `bool` | `True` selects mode 2: `ts_binary` generates a `vite.config.mjs` and passes it with the entry, the output directory and the stylesheet. Default `False` |

The two invocation modes and the recipe for a bundler of your own are in
[Bundling](../guides/bundling.md#custom-bundler-bundlerinfo-interface).

## NpmPackageInfo

`NpmPackageInfo` is not exported from `@rules_typescript//ts:defs.bzl`. It loads
from `@rules_typescript//ts/private:providers.bzl`, and everything under
`ts/private/` is [volatile](../compatibility.md#volatile). Every `@npm` package
target returns it, and so does a workspace member's hub view
`npm_workspace_package`; a `node_modules` target links `store`'s tree under
`package_name`, `ts_compile` resolves a direct dep to that link, and `store`
names the snapshot's tree in [the store](node-modules.md#the-store).

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `package_name` | `string` | The npm name, `react` or `@types/react`; what the tree links the package as |
| `package_version` | `string` | The version; `0.0.0` on a workspace member, which pnpm resolves by path |
| `peer_id` | `string` | A filesystem-safe token naming the peer set this resolution was made against, empty for a package pnpm resolved only one way. Two snapshots can share `name@version` and differ only here |
| `package_dir` | `File or None` | The `package.json` at the root of the extracted package. `None` on a workspace member, whose compile writes the manifest as built |
| `package_root` | `string` | Exec-root-relative directory the files in `all_files` hang off: where `package_dir` sits for an extracted tarball, the member's directory under `bazel-bin` for a workspace member |
| `all_files` | `depset of File` | Every file of the package (`package.json`, `.js`, `.d.ts`, other assets), the files its store tree copies; a member's are its outputs, the manifest as built in place of the src |
| `transitive_deps` | `depset of NpmPackageInfo` | Every npm package reachable from this one, the paired `@types/*` package included |
| `store` | `NpmStoreInfo` | The snapshot's store tree and the links beside it: `key`, `tree`, `links`, `transitive` (`npm/private/store.bzl`) |

The package's `exports`, `types` and `main` are nowhere in it: tsgo and node
read the manifest in the tree, as they do over an install.

## DevServerInfo

The default `//oj:dev_server` and optional `//vite:dev_server` return this
provider. `ts_dev_server(server = ...)` accepts other implementations too.

oj 0.2.5 uses a native binary, the Vite config dialect and native React Fast
Refresh. It ignores config fields `root` and `cacheDir`;
its root and cache come from the launcher. `server.open` is supported.

The table below describes the optional Vite implementation.

| Field | Type | Vite | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `server_binary` | `File or None` | `None` | The server executable, for a server that is a build artifact. `None` when it ships inside the npm tree |
| `server_in_tree` | `string` | `"vite/bin/vite.js"` | The executable's path under the importer's `node_modules` directory, for a server that ships as an npm package. Exactly one of the two is set |
| `argv` | `list of string` | `["dev", "--config", "{config}"]` | The command line after the executable. `{config}` expands to the generated config's path, `{port}` to the `port` attr, `{root}` to the directory served |
| `config_dialect` | `string` | `"vite"` | The config format the server is handed. Only `"vite"` is generated today; a server reading its own format declares its own dialect, and the generator has to learn it before that server can be selected |
| `runs_in_js_runtime` | `bool` | `True` | `True` when the executable is JavaScript and the toolchain Node runs it. A native server still gets the toolchain Node on `PATH`, for a plugin host that is a Node process |
| `ignored_config_fields` | `list of string` | `[]` | Dotted config paths the server does not honour. A target whose configuration reaches one fails at analysis time naming the field and the server |
| `native_react_refresh` | `bool` | `False` | `True` when the server applies React Fast Refresh itself. `react_refresh = True` then fails at analysis time |
| `runtime_deps` | `depset of File` | empty | Everything the server needs in runfiles beyond the generated config and the importer's `node_modules` |

A server shipping as an npm package has no `File` to point at: its executable is
a path under the importer's `node_modules` directory, reached through the
package's link, which no artifact names. That is why `server_in_tree` exists
beside `server_binary`.

## NodeModulesInfo

A [`node_modules`](node-modules.md) target returns it; `ts_codegen`,
`ts_binary`, `ts_dev_server` and `esbuild_bundle` read it from their
`node_modules` attr, and take the target's `DefaultInfo.files` -- every link
and every store tree the links reach -- as inputs or runfiles; `ts_compile`
and `ts_test` follow `parent` up the chain and stage the links a direct dep
resolves to ([The Chain](node-modules.md#the-chain)), and from `hoist`, the
lockfile's hidden hoist carried unchanged down the chain, the links whose
names the closure holds ([The Store](node-modules.md#the-store)).

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `label` | `Label` | The `node_modules` target's: the importer's package, and what a message names |
| `dir` | `string` | The importer's `node_modules` directory as a bin-dir path, `bazel-out/<cfg>/bin/<package>/node_modules`: the parent of every link, which no artifact names |
| `links` | `dict of string -> NpmLinkInfo` | Per package name, the declared symlink `node_modules/<name>` and the store it enters |
| `parent` | `NodeModulesInfo or None` | The importer above's |
| `hoist` | `NpmHoistInfo` | The lockfile's hidden hoist, the root importer's `hoist` target's, the same on every importer of its chain ([NpmHoistInfo](#npmhoistinfo)) |

## NpmHoistInfo

A lockfile's hidden hoist, what its `npm_store_hoist` target
`node_modules/.pnpm/node_modules` returns
([The Store](node-modules.md#the-store)); the root importer names the target
in `hoist`, and every importer on the chain carries it as
`NodeModulesInfo.hoist`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `links` | `dict of string -> NpmLinkInfo` | Per hoisted name, the declared symlink `node_modules/.pnpm/node_modules/<name>` (a `public-hoist-pattern` match's at the root importer's `node_modules/<name>`) and the store it enters |
| `members` | `dict of string -> File` | Per hoisted workspace member, the declared symlink alone, with no dependency on the member's tree; a consumer's closure holds the tree through the member's link target |

## NpmLinkInfo

One link `node_modules/<name>` into a store tree: an entry of
`NodeModulesInfo.links`, and what a [`node_modules_member`](node-modules.md)
target returns beside the member's `TsInfo` and `NpmPackageInfo`, so a
`ts_compile` or `ts_test` names the link target in `deps` where it named the
hub's view, and a `ts_codegen` names it there for a generator that resolves
the member.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `link` | `File` | The declared symlink `node_modules/<name>` |
| `store` | `NpmStoreInfo` | The store the link enters |

## Toolchain Contract

`@rules_typescript//ts/toolchain:defs.bzl` exports seventeen names: six
toolchain type labels, five providers, and six accessors.

```python
load(
    "@rules_typescript//ts/toolchain:defs.bzl",
    "JS_RUNTIME_TOOLCHAIN_TYPE",
    "JS_TOOL_TOOLCHAIN_TYPE",
    "LAUNCHER_TOOLCHAIN_TYPE",
    "OXC_TOOLCHAIN_TYPE",
    "TOOLS_TOOLCHAIN_TYPE",
    "TSGO_TOOLCHAIN_TYPE",
    "JsRuntimeInfo",
    "LauncherInfo",
    "OxcToolchainInfo",
    "ToolsInfo",
    "TsgoToolchainInfo",
    "get_js_runtime",
    "get_js_tool",
    "get_launcher_toolchain",
    "get_oxc_toolchain",
    "get_tools_toolchain",
    "get_tsgo_toolchain",
)
```

| Type label | Target | Runs on | Accessor | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `OXC_TOOLCHAIN_TYPE` | `//ts/toolchain:oxc_toolchain_type` | the exec platform | `get_oxc_toolchain(ctx)` | `OxcToolchainInfo` |
| `TSGO_TOOLCHAIN_TYPE` | `//ts/toolchain:tsgo_toolchain_type` | the exec platform | `get_tsgo_toolchain(ctx)` | `TsgoToolchainInfo` |
| `TOOLS_TOOLCHAIN_TYPE` | `//ts/toolchain:tools_toolchain_type` | the exec platform | `get_tools_toolchain(ctx)` | `ToolsInfo` |
| `LAUNCHER_TOOLCHAIN_TYPE` | `//ts/toolchain:launcher_toolchain_type` | the target platform | `get_launcher_toolchain(ctx)` | `LauncherInfo`, or `None` when no toolchain resolved |
| `JS_RUNTIME_TOOLCHAIN_TYPE` | `//ts/toolchain:js_runtime_type` | the target platform | `get_js_runtime(ctx)` | `JsRuntimeInfo`, or `None` when no toolchain resolved |
| `JS_TOOL_TOOLCHAIN_TYPE` | `//ts/toolchain:js_tool_type` | the exec platform | `get_js_tool(ctx)` | `JsRuntimeInfo`, or `None` when no toolchain resolved |

The labels are `Label()` values, so they resolve in this ruleset's own
repository mapping and keep working under another repository name.

Node fills two roles that resolve against different platforms. `js_runtime_type`
is the runtime a `ts_test` or `ts_binary` program executes on: it is built for
the target platform and staged into runfiles. `js_tool_type` is Node as a build
tool (the `node_modules` tree builder, `ts_codegen`, the bundlers): it runs on
the exec platform. The two are equal under a plain host
build and differ the moment `--platforms` does.

| Provider | Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OxcToolchainInfo` | `oxc_binary` | `File` | The oxc-bazel CLI binary |
| `TsgoToolchainInfo` | `tsgo_binary` | `File` | The tsgo CLI binary |
| `ToolsInfo` | `tsaction` | `File` | The runner behind the TsConfig, TsEmit, tsgo, TsLint, TsTestPaths, TsManifest and NpmStore actions |
| | `lcov_merger` | `File` | `ts_test`'s coverage merger, run through `//ts/toolchain:lcov_merger_resolved` |
| | `copy_to_workspace` | `File` | The copier `ts_refresh_tsconfig` writes the source tree with |
| `LauncherInfo` | `launcher` | `File` | The launcher a `ts_test`, `ts_binary`, `ts_dev_server` or `npm_bin` executable is a symlink of |
| `JsRuntimeInfo` | `runtime_binary` | `File` | The runtime executable: node, or a Deno, Bun or wrapper a consumer registers |
| | `runtime_name` | `string` | The name diagnostics use; `"node"` for the shipped toolchains |
| | `args_prefix` | `list of string` | Arguments placed before the entry script |

A rule declares the types it needs and reads them through the accessors:

```python
load(
    "@rules_typescript//ts/toolchain:defs.bzl",
    "JS_TOOL_TOOLCHAIN_TYPE",
    "TSGO_TOOLCHAIN_TYPE",
    "get_js_tool",
    "get_tsgo_toolchain",
)

def _impl(ctx):
    tsgo = get_tsgo_toolchain(ctx).tsgo_binary
    node = get_js_tool(ctx)
    ...

my_rule = rule(
    implementation = _impl,
    toolchains = [
        TSGO_TOOLCHAIN_TYPE,
        config_common.toolchain_type(JS_TOOL_TOOLCHAIN_TYPE, mandatory = False),
    ],
)
```

`get_oxc_toolchain`, `get_tsgo_toolchain` and `get_tools_toolchain` index
`ctx.toolchains` directly, so a rule listing any of the three types as mandatory
fails toolchain resolution when nothing registers one. `get_js_runtime`,
`get_js_tool` and `get_launcher_toolchain` return `None` for a type declared
with `mandatory = False` that nothing registered; `ts_compile` declares tsgo and
the JS tool that way, and oxc and the tools as mandatory; the four rules that
run a launcher declare it that way and fail analysis naming the target platform
when none resolved.

`register_toolchains("@rules_typescript//ts/toolchain:all")` registers every
instance: one oxc toolchain, built from source by rules_rs for whichever exec
platform runs the build; one tsgo toolchain per platform in `TSGO_PLATFORMS`,
constrained on the exec platform; one source-built tools toolchain for the execution platform and one source-built launcher toolchain per supported target platform; one Node runtime toolchain
per platform in `NODE_PLATFORMS`, constrained on the target platform; and one
Node tool toolchain per platform, constrained on the exec platform.

Which compiler the tsgo toolchains hold is the `ts` extension's to say, and it
reads a pnpm lockfile: the root importer's `typescript` entry names the version,
and the `packages:` entries of that version's platform packages
(`@typescript/typescript-<os>-<cpu>`) carry the tarball and integrity of each
`lib/tsc`, which is what the per-platform repository rule downloads and
verifies. A consumer names its own lockfile:

```python
ts = use_extension("@rules_typescript//ts:extensions.bzl", "ts")
ts.tsgo(pnpm_lock = "//:pnpm-lock.yaml")
```

With no call the lockfile is rules_typescript's own
`ts/private/tsgo/pnpm-lock.yaml`. `ts.tsgo(version = "...")` is the alternative
for a release no lockfile states, downloaded unverified;
`package = "@typescript/native-preview"` selects the nightly, whose binary is
`lib/tsgo`. `TsgoToolchainInfo.tsgo_binary` is that file either way.

### Runtime input lifetime

Native binaries and node:test runners exec the configured runtime with the launcher's PID, process group, terminal and stdio. Their runtime view is a declared build output: the launcher neither creates a temporary application tree nor removes inputs when the original process exits. Surviving children can read those inputs for the lifetime of Bazel's outputs; an action sandbox still has Bazel's own lifetime.

The view preserves selected File provenance, canonical module coordinates and one internal authority for each ordinary File or npm store. It does not promise inode identity with an outside source or store. The native child receives the built view as its runfiles directory. Standard runfiles lookup and module imports therefore select the same module and npm store authority. The view carries Bazel's generated repository mapping unchanged. Package the launcher's runfiles with its generated config and complete runtime directory, retaining internal relative links; a runfiles manifest may relocate that group but cannot scatter its members independently. The configured runtime executable is resolved through its original runfiles.

Vitest and dev-server retain their mutable per-run setup and post-run behavior. Their owned workspace `node_modules` link is removed nonrecursively; private temporary trees are removed recursively.

### tsgo from source

`//ts/toolchain/tsgo_source` is the same compiler built by rules_go.
`ts/private/tsgo_source/go.mod` names
`github.com/microsoft/typescript-go/cmd/tsgo` in a `tool` directive and
requires the module at the commit the lockfile's `typescript` release was
built from, so the two toolchains run one compiler at one revision, and a
change the ruleset makes to that source reaches a build that registers this
one. The `ts` extension reads the go.mod and its go.sum and declares one
Gazelle-written `go_repository` per require, the module's dependencies under
the names Gazelle writes for them; `@tsgo_source//:tsgo` aliases the module's
`cmd/tsgo` binary, and the toolchain over it constrains no platform, since
`cfg = "exec"` on the binary builds it for whichever platform runs the build.
The lockfile's binary reads its `lib/*.d.ts` from beside itself
(`-tags=noembed`); this build embeds them, so the binary is one file and its
listings name them under `bundled:///libs/`. The toolchain is outside
`//ts/toolchain:all`, so a consumer registers it by name, first:

```python
register_toolchains(
    "@rules_typescript//ts/toolchain/tsgo_source",
    "@rules_typescript//ts/toolchain:all",
)

Two changes ride on that build, each a file under `ts/private/tsgo_source/`
that `go_repository`'s `patches` (`-p1`) applies to the module's repository
before rules_go compiles it.

`isolated-declarations-bound-expando.patch`: under
`isolatedDeclarations` the 7.0.2 compiler crashes on an exported initializer
of the shape `f().p || ""` (`panic: Unhandled case in Node.Text:
*ast.CallExpression`): the declaration tracker's `isBoundExpando` took every
binary expression with a property access on its left for an expando
assignment and asked the resolver about the head of that access chain, which
the resolver reads as an identifier. Patched, it asks only when the operator
is `=` and the head is an identifier, and the compiler reports `TS9013` where
TypeScript 5.9 reports `TS9007`. The patch carries the module's own case,
`isolatedDeclarationsBoundExpandoCallee`, with its baselines;
`//tests/integration:oxc_declarations_test` runs `TsgoCheck` over the shape
under this toolchain and expects `TS9013`. The lockfile's binary keeps the
crash.

`module-augmentation-include-reason.patch`: a `declare module "<name>"`
augmentation resolves its module as an import does and adds no file, and the
7.0.2 compiler records no reason for it, so `--explainFiles` lists the
augmented file with the imports that reached it and never the augmentation.
Patched, a module the program holds is listed with `Augmented via "<name>"
from file '<augmenting file>'` (with the `packageId` where the resolution has
one) and the related info `File is augmented here.`; the program's file set
is unchanged, so a module nothing imports is still `TS2664`. The patch carries
the module's own case, `TestExplainFilesModuleAugmentation` in
`internal/compiler/program_test.go`;
`//tests/integration:gazelle_roundtrip_test` registers this toolchain first
and expects `//augmented`'s dep on the package its `probe.ts` augments and
never imports. The lockfile's binary lists no augmentation, so Gazelle over
it writes no such dep.

The pin moves in `ts/private/tsgo_source` with
`go get github.com/microsoft/typescript-go@<commit> && go mod tidy`; for
TypeScript 7.1 the Go code moved into `github.com/microsoft/TypeScript` under
`tsc/`, so the next pin changes the module path in the `tool` line and the
require. `//ts/private/tsgo:tsgo_test` reads the revision the lockfile's
linux-amd64 binary embeds (`go version -m` prints it as `vcs.revision`) and
fails when it is not the pinned one, naming both, so a `typescript` bump in
the lockfile names the pin to move. A build that first resolves the toolchain
compiles the module: 91 sandboxed actions, 113.5 s wall and an 89.6 s critical
path on a 22-core machine at load 11, cached after. rules_go's apparent name
in this module is `io_bazel_rules_go`, the name Gazelle writes into the BUILD
files of a repository with no MODULE.bazel of its own.

`//tests/toolchain:foreign_target_platform_test` pins the split. It analyses a
probe rule under `--platforms=//platforms:windows_amd64`, a platform with a Node
runtime and no compiler binary: oxc and tsgo still resolve to exec-platform
binaries, the staged runtime is `nodejs_windows_amd64`, and the tool runtime is
not.
