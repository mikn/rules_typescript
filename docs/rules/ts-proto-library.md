# Protobuf TypeScript sources

`ts_proto_library` generates the direct sources of one `proto_library` with protobuf-es 2.12.0, then passes those TypeScript files to the existing source-mode `ts_compile` owner.

```starlark
ts_proto_library(name = "messages", proto = ":messages_proto", out_dir = "generated", tsconfig = "tsconfig.json", node_modules = ":node_modules", deps = ["@npm//:bufbuild_protobuf"], options = ["target=ts", "json_types=true"])
```

| Attribute                          | Contract                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `proto`                            | One `proto_library` with direct sources; its graph owns imports and import-prefix mapping.                                                           |
| `out_dir`                          | Package-relative generated directory. Canonical proto import paths determine nested output paths.                                                    |
| `tsconfig`, `node_modules`, `deps` | Existing `ts_compile` inputs. Declare generated sibling libraries and the consumer's protobuf runtime in `deps`.                                     |
| `options`                          | Options passed directly to protobuf-es, defaulting to `target=ts`. Supports `json_types=true` and `import_extension`. Output must remain TypeScript. |

The rule calls protobuf's `proto_common.compile` with its protoc executable and the declared protobuf-es plugin. The proto dependency enables protobuf's source-info flag to preserve comments. Only direct files are generated; imported TypeScript modules belong to their own generated libraries.

The Bazel target graph selects schemas. The rule does not interpret Buf configuration or apply managed schema options. Schema options affecting generated descriptors belong in the proto sources. Migration from managed generation requires comparing committed outputs against the declared schema graph.

## Generated BUILD targets

[Gazelle protobuf identities](../gazelle/directives.md#protobuf-generation-identities) generate wrappers from native proto rules. A common ancestor package owns each product output root; native schema packages retain their own targets. Different plugin options use different identities, while sibling dependencies remain inside each identity.

## Invariants

1. Canonical proto import paths determine generated paths. The import-prefix fixture fails if generated sibling imports no longer resolve.
2. Each proto target owns only its direct generated files. The two-library fixture fails on duplicate ownership or missing imported sources.
3. Generated TypeScript uses the existing source-mode compiler and test runner. The JSON source-runtime fixture fails if emit-disabled generated sources cannot compile or execute.
