"""Analysis tests: build actions must run the exec platform's Node.

The target platform under test is windows_amd64, for which this ruleset ships a
Node.js runtime.  A rule that runs Node inside an action must still reach for the
exec platform's binary — resolving the target platform's one produces an action
that cannot run at all.
