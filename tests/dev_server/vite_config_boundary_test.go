// The vite_config boundary: where the rule loads a user-supplied config from,
// and therefore what that config is allowed to import.
//
// Node resolves a runfiles symlink to the source file before it resolves that
// file's own imports, so a vite_config loaded out of the source tree resolves
// its imports against a source-tree node_modules -- which this ruleset does not
// have, and which no part of the build graph would know about if it did. So the
// rule loads a COPY in bin, beside the npm tree the node_modules attr built, and
// that copy is what draws the boundary:
//
//   - the launcher is pointed at the copy, not at the source file;
//   - a BARE npm specifier in the config resolves through that tree
//     (:dev_with_user_config_behaviour_test proves it over HTTP, since only a
//     running server shows the plugin actually installed);
//   - a RELATIVE import resolves only when the module it names is declared in
//     vite_config_srcs, because that is what stages it beside the copy. An
//     UNDECLARED sibling is not there, and the dev server refuses to start,
//     naming the file, rather than coming up with half a config.
//
// Also here, because it is a property of the same generated file: the config
// reaches @vitejs/plugin-react through that package's own exports map, never
// through a path into its dist/. That the resolution works is proved by the
// react behaviour tests; what is asserted here is that it is resolution at all.
