"""Analysis-time proof that the `ide_fragments` group reaches a private target.

Visibility governs dependency edges. An aspect propagates along the edges a
build already has and creates none, so it needs no grant where a rule's `deps`
would: //tests/lsp/fragment_fixture:leaf is `//visibility:private`, and naming it
from this package -- here, or in `ide_tsconfig(deps = [...])`, or in a filegroup
-- is a visibility error. Applying the aspect to :root reaches it anyway, which
is the whole reason the fragments exist.
