#
# `bazel build //...`, `bazel test //...` and a byte-identical Gazelle rerun are
# all satisfied by a Gazelle run that DELETES a test target, which is how seven
# hand-written go_test targets once went missing. This check is not: the set of
# test files on disk is not something Gazelle writes, so it cannot be brought
# back into agreement by damaging the BUILD files.
#
# Tagging a test `manual` is the same regression wearing a disguise -- the target
# still exists, still claims its srcs, and `bazel test //...` still passes,
# because `//...` skips it. So the file's claim is checked twice: once against
# every test target, and once against only the targets `bazel test //...` runs.
# A file that has the first claim but not the second is manual-only, and must be
# named in MANUAL_ONLY below with a reason. The list is exact in both directions,
# so tagging a test `manual` fails here until someone writes down why, and
# untagging it fails until the entry is removed.
#
# Read-only -- a loading-phase query and `git ls-files`. It never runs Gazelle
# and never writes to the source tree.
#
# One limit it does not cover: `git ls-files` cannot see an unstaged new file, so
# a local run reports green on a test that has no target yet.
