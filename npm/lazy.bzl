"""Declares one repository per resolved npm package, plus an alias hub.

A single repository for the whole lockfile has to download everything before it
can generate any target: it reads `bin` and `exports` out of each extracted
`package.json`. On a 2731-package lockfile that is roughly five minutes and five
gigabytes, paid in full by a target whose only npm dependency is vitest, in one
serial Starlark loop with no resume.

Here the extension does the whole-graph analysis -- which it can do from the
lockfile text alone, with no network -- and then declares one `npm_import` per
resolved package. Each one reads its own `package.json` and writes its own BUILD
file, so Bazel fetches repositories on demand.

The unit is the SNAPSHOT, not the package
-----------------------------------------
pnpm resolves a package once per distinct peer set and writes each outcome as its
own `snapshots:` key: `@storybook/react@8.6.14(react@18.3.1)` and
`@storybook/react@8.6.14(react@19.0.0)` are one tarball and two different
dependency graphs. Keying anything by `name@version` merges them, and the merge
is silent -- every version in the merged result is a real version, so the only
symptom is an importer built against the other variant's transitive closure.

So the graph is keyed by snapshot id throughout, and a snapshot's repository name
carries its peer set. A peer-free snapshot keeps the plain `<name>__<version>`
repository name it has always had.

Resolution is per importer
--------------------------
`importers:` records, for each workspace member, the snapshot each declared
dependency resolved to -- and two members legitimately resolve one name to
different majors. A single flat hub cannot express that, so each importer gets
its own package inside the hub: `@npm//path/to/member:react` is what that member
declared, while `@npm//:react` is the whole-lockfile namespace (the root
importer's resolution where it has one, the highest version otherwise).

The analysis stays here rather than moving into the packages because all of it is
a whole-graph decision that one package cannot make about itself:

  label assignment      `@npm//:react` means the highest version present, which
                        is only knowable across the whole lockfile
  @types pairing        matching react@19 to @types/react@19 requires seeing both
  cycle breaking        npm has genuine circular peer dependencies and a Bazel
                        target graph may not contain a cycle
  alias naming          an npm alias is a name no package claims as its own, so
                        only the graph knows the alias exists
  patch routing         `patchedDependencies` is keyed by name@version at the
                        top of the lockfile, nowhere near the package it patches
  platform partition    which platforms a tarball is for decides which select()
                        branch may reference it
