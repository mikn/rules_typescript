"""pnpm lockfile reader: the whole-graph analysis behind the npm extension.

Everything here runs on lockfile text alone, with no network and no extracted
package, so npm/lazy.bzl can analyse the whole graph inside the module extension
and then declare one already-resolved repository per package.

What the lockfile has already decided, and we therefore must NOT re-derive:

  catalogs           every use site carries a concrete `version:`, so the
                     `catalogs:` block is dead weight.
  overrides          an override is a version SELECTION, so each outcome is
                     already its own `name@version` key in `packages:`.
  packageExtensions  injected peers appear in `snapshots:` as resolved
                     dependency edges, which _parse_snapshots ingests.

Each of those blocks is shaped exactly like the ones we do read -- `catalogs:`
entries look like importers, `overrides:` entries look like package keys -- so
every reader below anchors on its own `<section>:` header at indent 0 and stops
at the next indent-0 line. Nothing scans the file globally.

Two keyspaces, deliberately kept apart:

  packages:    one entry per published tarball, `name@version`. The bytes.
  snapshots:   one entry per RESOLUTION, `name@version(peer@version)...`. pnpm
               resolves a package once per distinct peer set and gives each
               outcome its own dependency edges, so this -- not `packages:` --
               is what a dependency graph may be keyed by.
  importers:   one entry per workspace member, naming the snapshot each of its
               declared dependencies resolved to. Two members can and do point
               at different snapshots of the same package name.

What the lockfile does NOT resolve is `patchedDependencies:`. The `packages:`
integrity is the byte-identical PRE-patch registry tarball, so the patch has to
be fetched and applied by whoever downloads the package.

# `importers:` lists every workspace member by its path relative to the
# lockfile, and for each declared dependency records the specifier the member
# asked for and the version pnpm resolved it to:
#
#   importers:
#     .:
#       dependencies:
#         shared:          {specifier: workspace:*,      version: link:packages/shared}
#         tailwindcss-v3:  {specifier: npm:tailwindcss@3.4.18, version: tailwindcss@3.4.18}
#         zod:             {specifier: ^3.0.0,           version: 3.24.2}
#
# Two of the three forms matter to us, and the `version:` value alone tells
# them apart -- the specifier is never needed:
#
#   link:<path>   a workspace member. The path is relative to the IMPORTER, not
#                 to the lockfile, so it is resolved against the importer path
#                 before it can become a "//<path>:<name>" label.
#   <name>@<ver>  an npm alias: the member imports the package under a name
#                 that is not the package's own. A plain resolved version never
#                 contains "@", so an "@" past index 0 (index 0 being a scope,
#                 as in '@typescript/typescript6@6.0.2') is the discriminator.
#
# Peer suffixes are stripped first: `1.2.3(react@19.0.0)` is a plain version
# whose peer decoration would otherwise look like an alias.
#
# This reader anchors on `importers:` and stops at the next indent-0 line. It
# must stay that way: `catalogs:` is the same nesting idiom one level shallower,
# with catalog names sitting at indent 2 exactly where importer paths do and the
# same `specifier:`/`version:` pairs underneath, so a reader that scanned for

# ─── .npmrc: which registry a tarball comes from ──────────────────────────────
#
# A pnpm lockfile records a package's name@version and its integrity, and nothing
# about where the bytes came from: there is no registry field anywhere in the
# file. `.npmrc` is the only record, so a workspace on a private registry -- or
# with one scope on a private registry -- cannot be fetched without reading it.
#
# Two kinds of line decide a URL:
#   registry=https://npm.example.com/          the default for everything
#   @acme:registry=https://npm.example.com/    the default for one scope
#
# Credentials are deliberately not interpreted here. The module extension's
# output is written to MODULE.bazel.lock -- a committed, shared file -- and a
# repository rule's attribute values go into it verbatim, so a token that reaches
# an npm_import attribute is a token in git. So the extension loads
# `npmrc_registries` and nothing else, and npm_import reads the .npmrc itself at
# fetch time; what lands in the lock for that repository is the file's label.
#
# `~/.npmrc` is not read and cannot be: it lies outside the workspace, so Bazel
# cannot make it an input to anything, and two machines with different user-level
# files would then fetch different bytes from one lockfile and one lock. The part
# that legitimately varies per machine is the token, and `${VAR}` interpolation
# covers that without leaving the workspace.
