"""Module extension for npm dependency management.

Usage in MODULE.bazel:
    npm = use_extension("@rules_typescript//npm:extensions.bzl", "npm")
    npm.pnpm(version = "10.32.1")          # optional; defaults to _DEFAULT_PNPM_VERSION
    npm.translate_lock(pnpm_lock = "//:pnpm-lock.yaml")
    use_repo(npm, "npm", "pnpm")

Design note: when both the root workspace and rules_typescript register a repo
with the same name (e.g. "npm"), the root workspace wins.  This lets consumers
provide their own pnpm-lock.yaml while rules_typescript ships a default lockfile
for its own tests.  Non-root registrations for a name are silently skipped when
the root module has already claimed that name. A non-root module's hub that
does fill in serves that module's own targets (`@npm_esbuild` for
`//vite:vite_plugin_bazel`): its store sits in that module's lockfile package,
and a link never crosses a repository (docs/rules/node-modules.md § The Store).

A pnpm lockfile records name@version and integrity and no registry. The
extension reads the registry map the way pnpm does: this file's `registry=` and
`@scope:registry=` lines, then the `registries:` block and `registry:` of the
pnpm-workspace.yaml beside the lockfile, which needs no label because pnpm keeps
it there. A workspace whose registries are all in pnpm-workspace.yaml passes
nothing here:

    npm.translate_lock(

Credentials (`//host/:_authToken=`, `//host/:_auth=`) are NOT read by the
extension: each package's own fetch reads them, and pnpm's `auth` setting,
`PNPM_CONFIG__AUTH`, from its environment, because the extension's result is
written to MODULE.bazel.lock, which is committed. `${VAR}` in this file is
resolved at fetch time from the environment.

`~/.npmrc` is deliberately not consulted. Bazel cannot make a file outside the
workspace an input, so reading it would mean one lockfile and one lock fetching

pnpm keeps the patch paths in pnpm-workspace.yaml, which the extension cannot
turn into labels: a path like `patches/foo.patch` says nothing about where the
consumer's Bazel package boundaries fall. So pass the files as labels and the
extension pairs each one with its lockfile entry by filename, which is pnpm's
own naming (`<name with / replaced by __>@<version>.patch`):

Each label is then resolved to a file and checked against the sha256 the
lockfile records beside the entry, so a label that names nothing readable, or a
file pnpm never saw, fails here rather than wherever the patch mattered. So does
an entry with no matching file, and a file no entry claims.

A scoped package's patch keeps the leading '@' of its name, and a target name
starting with '@' cannot come out of `glob()` -- glob prefixes ':' onto such a
