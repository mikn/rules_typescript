"""The workspace-root tsconfig.json an IDE reads, built from the build graph.

Everything the file needs is already in the graph: a ts_compile target's package
is its source root, so the tsconfig is a declared output of a rule over an
aspect, and `bazel run //:refresh_tsconfig` only copies that output into the
source tree.

The `paths` map holds first-party packages: the package directory and its
bazel-bin twin, where a build leaves the .d.ts. npm packages are not in it. The
checkout's node_modules holds what the lockfile resolves, pnpm's links to the
workspace members included, and TypeScript walks it from the importing file the
way tsgo walks the forest a build stages; a `paths` key naming a copy of a
package's declarations would only send the editor somewhere the build does not
look.
